# VBA Challenege 

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to refactor our Module 2 VBA code to more simply iterate through the stock analysis data, and return 2017 and 2018 data for the listed tickers.

## Results
2017 was a much better year for the listed stocks overall, according to the data. In 2017, only 1 stock had a negative return while in 2018 10 stocks had a negative return.

## Summary
Refactoring code can help to simplify the code, and make it more concise, and read better to the user. However, it can also be time consuming and may not always be necessary. Refactoring code is great for fixing bugs and determining the root cause of issues certain code may have.
